Actionables

For Artist:
This path assumes you have some understanding of creating 3D Art for Games; and also familiar with Unreal Engine!

You can start off with Houdini to ease yourself into the code mindset, this playlist will teach you the very basics of Houdini!

Once you're a little bit more comfortable with Houdini and have some idea of coding you can continue on to discover more about the coding-equivalent in Houdini, which is VEX!

Now that you are familar with both VEX, Python and Houdini; you can try to combine it all into one; this teaches you how to utilize Python within Houdini.

At this point what you've learnt should be enough for you to utilize in your daily work and start creating tools or shaders!

For Tools and Pipeline inspiration:
You can take a look at this polycount thread by Marina Alexandra Bade where she goes into detail of how she created her Procedural Shanty Town!
