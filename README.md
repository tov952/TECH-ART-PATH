# TECH-ART-PATH
## Actionables:
- Talk to an Artist if you're a programmer!  Ask about their day-to-day; how do they problem solve?
- Talk to a Programmers if you're an artist! Ask about their day-to-day; how do they make art?

### Dip your toes ( For Artists ):
This path assumes you have some understanding of creating 3D Art for Games; and you are also familiar with Unreal Engine!

You will probably need to install Houdini Apprentice, Unreal Engine and some version of Python!


1. You can start off with Houdini to ease yourself into the code mindset, this playlist will teach you the very basics of Houdini! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsv8UGqDibc&list=PLhyeWJ40aDkUDHDOhZQ2UkCfNiQj7hS5W

2. Then sprinkle some basic python introduction courses:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b093aqAZiPU

4. Once you're a little bit more comfortable with Houdini and have some idea of coding you can continue on to discover more about the coding-equivalent in Houdini, which is VEX:  https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/vex-isnt-scary/

4. Now that you are familar with both VEX, Python and Houdini; you can try to combine it all into one; this teaches you how to utilize Python within Houdini:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4O0mtUTJdk&list=PL5V9qxkY_RnJstgKRPN8cCErK4oYB8Fax

5. Hopefully by this point you are comfortable with manipulating geometry with code and have some idea of 3D Math; now you can start playing with shading languages:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsXB1PQdGx0&list=PLoHLpVCC9RmMMmW5eP1aAyJrTjxd46rx_

At this point what you've learnt should be enough for you to utilize in your daily work and start creating tools or shaders!

### Dip your toes ( For Programmers ):
This path assumes you have can code and are also familiar with Unreal Engine!

You will probably need to install Houdini Apprentice, Unreal Engine and some version of Python!

1. You could start off creating shaders in Unreal with HLSL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsXB1PQdGx0&list=PLoHLpVCC9RmMMmW5eP1aAyJrTjxd46rx_

2. Then some basic python introduction courses:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b093aqAZiPU

3. You can also try learning the Game Art workflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Iu88tZ9utE

4. Once you're a little familiar with the game art workflow, you can try diving into Houdini to try out procedural modelling! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsv8UGqDibc&list=PLhyeWJ40aDkUDHDOhZQ2UkCfNiQj7hS5W

5. And if you're now familiar with Houdini, you might want to try out VEX which should feel very similar to C:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4O0mtUTJdk&list=PL5V9qxkY_RnJstgKRPN8cCErK4oYB8Fax

6. Now that you are familar with both VEX, Python and Houdini; you can try to combine it all into one; this teaches you how to utilize Python within Houdini:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4O0mtUTJdk&list=PL5V9qxkY_RnJstgKRPN8cCErK4oYB8Fax

## Tools and Pipeline inspiration:
You can take a look at this polycount thread by Marina Alexandra Bade where she goes into detail of how she created her Procedural Shanty Town!
